# Mouse_brain_borders_NatureProtocols

This repository contains example code for analyzing scRNAseq and CITE-seq data, as described in  Scheyltjens et al. (Single-cell RNA and protein profiling of immune cells from the mouse brain and its border tissues, Nature Protocols, 2022)\
For this example, we've used CITE-seq data of mouse glioblastoma tumors from [Antunes et al (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33782623/)

### Code
- Supplementary R Notebook 1.Rmd - code for preprocessing and clustering of a scRNAseq/CITE-seq dataset
- Supplementary R Notebook 2.Rmd - code for preprocessing and clustering of the ADT portion from a CITE-seq dataset
